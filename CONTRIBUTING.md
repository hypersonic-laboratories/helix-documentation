# Thank You For Helping!

## General
- The docs are built on [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
    - They both, unsuprisingly, have good documentation: [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/), [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/). Reference this often if stuck.
- Generally follow [Microsoft writing guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/)
