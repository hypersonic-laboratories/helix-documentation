# HELIX's Tooling Ecosystem

**HELIX Studio** is a collection of tools built on top on Unreal Engine 5. In combination with the **Launcher**, it provides the tools needed to create fantastic worlds and experiences.

## Studio

![](../_images/getting_started/StudioSpam.jpg)

- As an Unreal plugin everything you know about Unreal is relevant, and everything you learn will help you progress as a developer
- HELIX adds functions for the most common use cases, allowing you to make an RP game far easier than without our tooling (e.g. asset cooking, code linking, hot reload, etc.).
    - The table below highlights some elements (accessible via the top center icons):

| :material-earth:  | :material-pencil-ruler: |
|:------------------|:-----|
| Start VS Code     | Import Asset |
| Server Hot Reload | New Assets/Packages/Items|
| Publish World     | Publish Assets |

## Launcher

Note that **HELIX's Launcher** also contains some key tools to ease your development experience.
