# Your First Game

### Goal
We're going to create a fully functional roleplaying map, using [QB-Core](../scripting/qbcore.md) (1) and an urban downtown map, that you can then further customize to your heart's content.
{ .annotate }

1.  QB-Core is a widely-used roleplaying framework, popular in the
    FiveM/GTA ecosystem. It has been ported specifically to HELIX's Lua API by its maintainer (Kakarot) to enable you to quickly make great games.

-   __Keep Learning__

    Either step-by-step or through examples.

    [:material-file-document-check-outline: See Tutorials](../tutorials/index.md)

-   __Alter The Functionality__

	Modify or create parts of the framework (e.g. tweak occupation values, create UI elements, etc.)

    [:octicons-file-code-24: View API](../api/index.md)

    [:material-file-document-outline: QB-Core Docs](../scripting/qbcore.md)

-   __Keep Exploring__

    One of the best ways to learn is to get inspiration from other works. Play games others have created to see what's possible!
