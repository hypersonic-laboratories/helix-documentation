# Resources

- For *quicker help* check out our [Developer Discord](https://discord.gg/helixcreators) - there you can talk to Helix employees, fellow developers, and work through problems alongside others.
- For *long-term knowledge*, that's what **this docs site** is for! If you notice anything missing, please comment/create an edit via the buttons in the top right of any page.
