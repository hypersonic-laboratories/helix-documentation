# Resources

- The best resource for live support is our developer [Discord](https://discord.gg/helixcreators) - there you can talk to Helix employees, fellow developers, and get the answers you need.
- For long-term knowledge, that's what ***this docs site** is for! If you notice anything missing, please comment/create an edit via the buttons in the top right of any page.
