## About HELIX

HELIX is an open-world multiplayer sandbox platform, specifically designed for roleplay. As a developer, you can create your own games, roleplaying servers, and virtual worlds using our extensive scripting API and creation tools.

- :fontawesome-solid-people-line: **Built By Creators, For Creators**{.whiter} - We see you. We see your ingenuity, your creativity, as you modify games in beautiful, frustrating ways, fighting the very systems you rely on. *HELIX is different.* Time to know what it feels like to be empowered alongside a community of creators.

- :material-chart-areaspline: **We Succeed When You Succeed**{.whiter} - With access to the [Add-on Vault](../tutorials/vault.md) (1) and extensive documentation, we strive to help you excel. Not to mention features like one-click-publishing and full IP ownership!

- :material-arrow-up-box: **Delightful Tooling**{.whiter} - HELIX is built on top of the well-used Unreal 5 game engine, allowing for unparalleled graphical fidelity and customization. We also provide an intuitive and powerful Lua API alongside a host of other useful tools.

1.  The Add-on Vault is a central repository of shared assets that contains
    everything you need to build your worlds and RP servers. Discover thousands of add-ons and mods from maps, characters, vehicles, weapons, Lua scripts to entire game modes!

<!-- , and mututally-beneficial monetization! (2) 
2.  Simply put, Hypersonic takes a cut of all the profits on HELIX. This means
    the success of the company is directly in-line with how successful you, the creators, are. In other words, our goals are mutually aligned! :partying_face: -->
