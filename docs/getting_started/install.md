---

To install HELIX, you'll need to install the launcher (downloadable on our website, [here-ToDo]())

From there, simply follow the installation instructions.

## Launcher Overview

1. Login or sign up using you HELIX account (register on our [main website](https://helixgame.com/))

/// warning | Closed Beta
We are currently in closed beta, meaning unless you have a login, you won't be able to make an account. We're scaling up to reach everyone as quick as we can, so hold tight if you don't have access yet!

2. Click on the Create Tab
3. Create a New Project (may require downloading Unreal Engine from the [Epic Games Store Launcher](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/download))
