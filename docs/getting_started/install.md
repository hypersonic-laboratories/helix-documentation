# Installing HELIX

## Make a HELIX Account

/// warning | Closed Beta
We are currently in closed beta, meaning unless you have a login, you won't be able to make an account. We're scaling up to reach everyone as quick as we can, so hold tight if you don't have access yet!
///

To get started, you will need an account.

1. Go to the [HELIX Website](https://helixgame.com/) to create an account.
2. Check for an e-mail from HELIX to confirm your account.

/// info | Please check your spam folder if you don't see a verification email in your inbox.
