## About HELIX

- **Built For Creators, By Creators** - We see you. We see your ingenuity, your creativity, as you modify games in beautiful, frustrating ways, fighting the very systems you need. *HELIX is different.* Time to know what it feels like to be empowered alongside a community of creators.

- **The Power of Unreal** - HELIX is intentionally built on top of the well-loved Unreal 5 game engine, allowing for unparalleled graphical fidelity and customization. Our import tools allow you to work on whatever complexity layer you like - this is creation without limits!

- **Helpful Resources** - From one click publishing to the [Vault](https://hub.helixgame.com/) (community created assets) to extensive documentation, we have all the resources you need to get started quickly and easily.
