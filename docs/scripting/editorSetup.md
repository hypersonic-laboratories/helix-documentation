VSCode (a free editor, available on all operating systems) is the only officially supported external editor, but other alternatives (e.g. Atom, IDEA) exist and can be used, albeit with less robust tooling.

1. Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download){.external}
2. Install Helix Lua API extension [WIP/ToDo] - includes LuaLanguageServer

See [QB-Core's setup page](https://docs.qbcore.org/qbcore-documentation/guides/visual-studio-code){.external} for more.

See our [Lua Style Guide](luaStyleGuide.md) for details about HELIX conventions.
