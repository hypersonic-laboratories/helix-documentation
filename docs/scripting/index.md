# Scripting

/// warning | WIP Content Ahead
Note that all pages beyone here were written for previous versions of Helix, and may not be perfectly up to date. I'm working on updating them, but it'll take a while - so be aware. The last edited date is in the bottom left of each page, as a way to track recency.
///

## Quickstart

1. Start VS Code from the top center of [Studio](../getting_started/creatorTools.md) :material-earth: icon
2. Install `vscode-lua` and `vscode-helix` for lua language support and Helix API autocomplete
3. Get coding with our [API reference](../api/index.md)

/// note | Autocomplete
The autocomplete plugin is heavily WIP, but we'll get it updated as soon as we can!
///

### Alternate Workflows

- The launcher allows you to start a server directly (:material-console: for any existing project), allowing you to ignore the Studio UI if you don't need/want it!
