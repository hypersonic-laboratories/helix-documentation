# Scripting

## Quickstart

1. Start VS Code from the top center of [Studio](../getting_started/creatorTools.md) :material-earth: icon
2. install `vscode-lua` and `vscode-helix` for lua language support and Helix API autocomplete
3. Get coding with our [API reference](../api/apiHome.md)

### Alternate Workflows

/// info | The launcher allows you to start a server directly (:material-console: for any existing project), allowing you to ignore the Studio UI if you don't need/want it!
