This sample code shows how to set Actors to be highlighted when behind walls, or always highlighted!

///tip

As highlighting is something calculated in Post Processing, it is really hard to define custom colors for individual entities.

Fortunately HELIX supports having **3** different colors which you can configure yourself!

///

#### To configure the global Highlight color for a specific index, use:

`Client.SetHighlightColor(highlight_color, index, mode)`

#### To enable the Highlight to a specific actor, use:

`my_entity:SetHighlightEnabled(true, index)`

///info

Valid indexes are **`0`**, **`1`** and **`2`**.

///


```lua title="Client/Index.lua"
-- Sets the Global desired Highlight color
-- Higher color values make it glow (e.g. Color(100, 0, 0))
local highlight_color = Color(10, 2.5, 0)
Client.SetHighlightColor(highlight_color, 0, HighlightMode.Always)

-- Setting all Characters to highlight
Character.Subscribe("Spawn", function(character)
    character:SetHighlightEnabled(true, 0)
end)
```
