Creating servers in HELIX is very simple and straightforward, just a few steps and you have your server up and ready!

## System Requirements

* OS: Windows
* Processor: `1.0 GHz` (faster core is better than multiple cores)
* Memory: `50 MB` (grows if having too many Players or spawned Entities)
* Storage: `10 MB` (+ Assets & Packages size)
* Network: Recommended at least `1 MB/s` (grows if having too many Players or spawned Entities)
* Network Forwarded Ports: `7777 TCP/UDP` and `7778 UDP` (you can change that in the Config)


## Installation

The Helix Server can be downloaded from the following location:

[HELIX SERVER](https://helix-item-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/HELIXGameServer.exe)

To start using it, refer to the [Scripting Quick Start](/docs/getting-started/quick-start.mdx)
