And then the asset migration will start, please wait for this process to complete.

![Untitled](\img\docs\assets-modding\importing-custom-assets\maps-levels\Untitled20.png)

## Setup Config.toml file

To load the map downloaded from the Marketplace in the studio, add the map name in the Config.toml file. The name of the map must be defined in the Config.toml file, this is a configuration file for the server where the world is going to be running. To do this, click on the ‚ÄúManage Helix World‚Äù icon and then click in ‚ÄúStart VS code‚Äù

![Untitled](\img\docs\assets-modding\importing-custom-assets\maps-levels\Untitled22.png)

After Visual Studio Code opens, navigate to ‚ÄúServer‚Äù folder and inside there will be the Config.toml file, double click on Config.toml to edit it.

![Untitled](\img\docs\assets-modding\importing-custom-assets\maps-levels\Untitled23.png)

The Config.toml file is divided by sections with configurations, inside the section [world] there‚Äôs a map variable with the current map assigned, by default the Blank map will be assigned but can be changed for a different one. 

![Untitled](\img\docs\assets-modding\importing-custom-assets\maps-levels\Untitled24.png)

To change the map and assign another one, the values must be in the form of: 

`[assetpack folder]::[map name]` ‚áí `cbedc-assetpack::Demo`

![Untitled](\img\docs\assets-modding\importing-custom-assets\maps-levels\Untitled25.png)

## Play the level to load the map.

![Untitled](\img\docs\assets-modding\importing-custom-assets\maps-levels\Untitled27.png)


> üí° Note: Different maps can be loaded (on at a time) by [modifying the Config.toml file](/assets-modding/studio/importing-custom-map.md#setup-configtoml-file)

## Publish the map as an asset.

Next step is to upload the asset to the HELIX Hub so others can see it or to be able to use it through the exchange creator.

On the tool bar at the top, click on the Asset Icon and then go to ‚ÄúPublish Asset‚Äù option to display the asset packs available. Select the asset pack containing the map created in prior steps.

![Untitled](\img\docs\assets-modding\importing-custom-assets\maps-levels\Untitled28.png)

After clicking on the asset pack containing the map, a message will appear in the corner of the screen indicating the files are being processed (In this step if there are windows dialog boxes related to the firewall, click on ‚ÄúAllow access‚Äù)

![Untitled](\img\docs\assets-modding\importing-custom-assets\maps-levels\Untitled29.png)

![Untitled](\img\docs\assets-modding\importing-custom-assets\maps-levels\Untitled30.png)

After all assets are processed a message will appear, and the asset will be visible in the asset exchange. Now the asset pack can be accessed via HELIX Hub.
